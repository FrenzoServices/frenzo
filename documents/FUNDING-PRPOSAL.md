# FRENZO – FUNDING PROPOSAL

### _Freedom to Scale. Own Your Growth._

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Frenzo is a global digital growth systems company focused on empowering creators and businesses to build **independent, scalable, and revenue-driven digital infrastructure**.

As platform dependency increases and monetization control shifts away from creators and businesses, Frenzo provides custom systems, automation tools, and AI-driven growth solutions that allow clients to:

- Own their audience
- Control their revenue
- Scale operations
- Reduce reliance on third-party platforms

Frenzo will grow in **four strategic phases**:

1. High-ticket services (WhatsApp + US clients)
2. Platform-led lead generation (Website + App)
3. Creator & business automation tools
4. AI-powered growth intelligence systems

This phased approach ensures early revenue, strong market validation, and long-term scalability.

## 2. Problem Statement

Creators and digital businesses today rely heavily on:

- Social platforms (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok)
- Marketplaces (Amazon, Shopify apps, app stores)

- Take significant fees
