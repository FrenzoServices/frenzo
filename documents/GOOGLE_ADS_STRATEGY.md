# Google Ads Strategy for Frenzo

## 🎯 Objective

Generate high-quality leads for:

1.  **High-Ticket Projects** (SaaS, Mobile Apps, AI Platforms).
2.  **Volume Entry** ($50 Starter Sites).

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Pre-Flight Checklist (Do this first!)

1.  **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)**:
    - Ensure GA4 is connected to your website.
    - **Action**: Verify you have a "Thank You" page or a specific event firing when someone submits the Contact Form. _You cannot run ads effectively without tracking conversions._

2.  **Google Ads Account**:
    - Create account at [ads.google.com](https://ads.google.com).
    - Link it to your GA4 account (Tools & Settings -> Linked Accounts).

3.  **Conversion Action**:
    - In Google Ads, go to **Goals > Conversions > Summary**.
    - Create a "Lead" conversion.
    - Method: Import from GA4 (e.g., "generate_lead" event).

## 🚀 Campaign Strategy

We will run **two separate campaigns** because the audiences are completely different.

### Campaign A: "The Empire Builder" (High Ticket)

- **Goal**: Leads for custom dev (React, AI, Mobile).
- **Budget**: Higher (e.g., ₹1,000 - ₹2,000 / day to start).
- **Keywords**: "SaaS development agency", "Hire React developers", "Custom AI chatbot development", "MVP builder services".
- **Negative Keywords**: "free", "cheap", "wordpress", "wix", "job", "internship" (Crucial to avoid filtering junk).
- **Landing Page**: `https://frenzo.services/services` or `https://frenzo.services`
- **Ad Copy**:
  - _Headline 1_: Build Your Own SaaS Platform
  - _Headline 2_: Stop Renting. Start Owning.
  - _Desc_: Custom React & Next.js Development. Zero Monthly Fees. 100% Code Ownership. Book Strategy.

### Campaign B: "The Starter" (Volume/Loss Leader)

- **Goal**: Sell the $50 / ₹2,000 Static Site.
- **Budget**: Lower (e.g., ₹500 / day).
- **Keywords**: "Cheap portfolio website", "Personal website developer", "Student resume website", "Static site hosting".
- **Landing Page**: `https://frenzo.services/pricing` (Result: They see the $50 deal immediately).
- **Ad Copy**:
  - _Headline 1_: Professional Portfolio - $50
  - _Headline 2_: Get Hired Faster.
  - _Desc_: Custom HTML5 Personal Site. Hosted Free on GitHub. 48-Hour Delivery. Claim Launch Offer.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

1.  **Click "New Campaign"**.
2.  **Objective**: Select "Leads".
3.  **Type**: Select "Search" (Avoid Display/Video for now, they waste money for agencies).
4.  **Bidding (CRITICAL STEP)**:
    - **The Trap**: Google will default to "Conversions". **Do NOT choose this yet.** You have 0 data, so Google will not know who to target and will waste money.
    - **The Fix**:
      1.  Click the blue link at the bottom: _"Or select a bid strategy directly (not recommended)"_.
      2.  Select **"Maximize Clicks"**.
      3.  Check the box: _"Set a maximum cost per click limit"_.
      4.  Set Limit: **₹80** (for Campaign A) or **₹40** (for Campaign B).
    - _Why?_ This forces Google to get you traffic cheap. Once you get 15 leads, THEN switch to Conversions.
5.  **Networks**: **Uncheck** "Display Network". Keep "Search Network".
6.  **Location & Strategy (CRITICAL)**:
    - **Rule**: Never mix Tier-1 (expensive) and Tier-3 (cheap) countries in the same ad group.

    ### 🖼️ Image Assets (Recommendations)
    - **Landscape (1.91:1)**:
      - _Idea_: A sleek laptop displaying code or a dashboard on a dark background.
      - _Idea_: Abstract "digital network" nodes connecting (for AI vibe).
    - **Square (1:1)**:
      - _Idea_: The frenzo logo on black.
      - _Idea_: A simple "5 Star" review graphic or "₹2,000" price tag graphic.
    - **Portrait (9:16)**:
      - _Idea_: A vertical smartphone screenshot of your mobile app demo.

9.  **Extensions**: Add "Sitelinks" to your Vision page and Contact page.

## ⚠️ Golden Rules

1.  **Don't spread budget too thin.** It's better to own one keyword (e.g., "SaaS Builder") than to barely show up for 50.
2.  **Check "Search Terms" weekly.** Go to Keywords > Search Terms. Look at what people _actually_ typed. If you see "cheap wix design", add "wix" to Negative Keywords immediately.
3.  **Speed Kills.** Call your leads within 5 minutes.

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Final Verification (Pre-Launch)

1.  **GCLID (Google Click ID) Check**:
    - **How it works**: When someone clicks your ad, Google adds `?gclid=...` to your URL.
    - **Action**: Your website is a Single Page App (React). It **automatically** preserves these tracking codes. You do not need to do anything extra. The tracking script I installed in `index.html` detects this automatically.

2.  **Call Assets (Action Required in Google Ads)**:
    - The code on the website is ready (`gtag` config set).
    - **You must now go to Google Ads > Assets > Call**:
      - Create a new **Call Asset**.
      - Phone Number: `+91 8904045305`
      - **Important**: Make sure "Call Reporting" is turned **ON**.
    - _Result_: Google will dynamically swap your phone number on the website with a Google Forwarding Number to track the call duration and status.

3.  **Confirm Conversions**:
    - Use the "Tag Assistant" (a Chrome Extension) or wait 24 hours after launch to see if the status changes from "Unverified" to "No recent conversions" (which means it's active).
